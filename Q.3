Q3. What is the output?


function f(n)
 if n == 0
 return 0
 else
 return n + f(n - 2)
print(f(6))

//ans = 12
because it's a recursive function and 
f(6)---given
Since 6 != 0, calculate 6 + f(4)
f(4)
Since 4 != 0, calculate 4 + f(2)
f(2)
Since 2 != 0, calculate 2 + f(0)
f(0):this becomes 0 now return and add 6+4+2=12
